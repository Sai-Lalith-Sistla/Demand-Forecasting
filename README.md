# Data Science for Demand Forecasting


## What is Demand Forecasting?
Demand forecasting is the process of predicting future customer demand for a product or service using historical data, statistical models, and machine learning techniques. It is a critical aspect of supply chain management, inventory planning, and financial forecasting.

## What Techniques are Available for Demand Forecasting?
Here are some commonly used techniques:

### Statistical Techniques:
- **Moving Averages**: Smoothens historical data to observe trends.
- **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**: Captures trends and seasonality with weighted averages.
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Handles time series with trends and seasonality.

### Machine Learning Techniques:
- **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Captures nonlinear relationships and interactions.
- **Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**: Combines weak learners for accurate predictions.
- **Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM)**: Excellent for capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### Advanced Methods:
- **Prophet by Facebook**: Designed for forecasting time series with trends and seasonality.
- **VAR (Vector AutoRegressive)**: Useful for multivariate time series.
- **Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS)**: Captures structural components like trends and seasonality probabilistically.

## Why Are These Metrics Used?
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes large errors more than smaller ones, making it ideal for high-stakes forecasts.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors, easy to interpret.
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Expresses errors as percentages, useful for business reporting.
- **R^2 (Coefficient of Determination)**: Indicates how much variance the model explains.
- **SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Addresses the asymmetry in MAPE for better reliability.
